# Dice Roller

Create a simple Java application that rolls a pair of dice 20 times. Display the value of the two dice each time they are rolled. Count how many times the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 7 are rolled and displayed the result. Create a class named `Dice` and add a method named `roll()` that generates a random number between 1 and 6. In your app, initialize two dice. Roll them 100 times, and track how many times 2, 4, 6, and 7. When it's done, print the totals.
